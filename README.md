# Simple Password Manager

## Project Description
The Simple Password Manager is a smart contract built on Ethereum to securely store and manage user credentials. Users can add, update, and delete their encrypted passwords associated with different usernames. The contract ensures that only the owner of the credentials can access and modify their stored data.

## Project Vision
The goal of this project is to provide a decentralized and secure way to manage passwords without relying on centralized servers. By leveraging blockchain technology, users have complete control over their credentials, ensuring privacy and security.

## Future Scope
- Integration with decentralized identity solutions.
- Support for multi-signature authentication.
- Implementation of password retrieval mechanisms using zero-knowledge proofs.
- A user-friendly front-end for easy interaction with the smart contract.

## Key Features
- **Secure Credential Storage**: Users can store their usernames and encrypted passwords securely.
- **Full User Control**: Only the credential owner can access and modify stored data.
- **Credential Management**: Users can add, update, and delete credentials as needed.
- **Decentralized & Tamper-proof**: Data is stored on the blockchain, preventing unauthorized modifications.
